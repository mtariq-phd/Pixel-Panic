Suggested improvements for depth and quality:

Add a scoring system:
Integrate points for surviving longer, dodging more obstacles, or collecting items—adds motivation and replay value.

Collectible items:
Adding gems or stars (activated by up key) would diversify gameplay and show multi-key interaction and collision handling.

Visual and audio feedback:
Particle effects, sound effects, music, or animated UI transitions enhance polish and player engagement.

Restart and pause functionality:
Allow players to restart without refreshing the page, and pause the game for improved usability.

Level progression and difficulty curve:
Use more nuanced metrics for level advancement (score/timer) with gradual difficulty adjustments instead of just frame counts.

Responsive design:
Make sure the game works well on different screen sizes or orientations (desktop, mobile).

Game state management:
For example, using modular code or classes, clean game loop architecture, and organized asset loading to demonstrate programming skills.

Save system or leaderboard:
Use localStorage for high scores or settings—shows ability to work with browser APIs and persistence.

UI/UX polish:
Include start menu, instructions, status messages, and game over screens that contribute to a smoother game flow.

Consider showing creativity and complexity by:

Adding multiple obstacle types with different behavior.

Introducing power-ups or penalties.

Creating dynamic backgrounds or themes.

Designing adaptive difficulty that reacts to player performance.

In short, the prototype covers the basic requirements well but adding scoring, collectibles, polish features, and demonstrating thoughtful code architecture and game design will help meet the brief's emphasis on complexity, creativity, and engaging user experience.
